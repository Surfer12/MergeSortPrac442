Certainly! I'll explain the `findDuplicates` method step by step, focusing on the for loop. Let's break it down:

```java:e:\Leetcode442\LeetCodeSubmission.java
public List<Integer> findDuplicates(int[] nums) {
    Set<Integer> seen = new HashSet<>();
    List<Integer> duplicates = new ArrayList<>();
    for (int num : nums) { // for each number in the array
        if (seen.contains(num)) { // if the number is in the seen set
            duplicates.add(num); // add the number to the duplicates list
        } else { // if the number is not in the seen set
            seen.add(num); // add the number to the seen set
        }
    }
    return duplicates; // return the duplicates list
}
```

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. We start by creating two data structures:
   - `seen`: A HashSet to keep track of numbers we've encountered.
   - `duplicates`: An ArrayList to store the duplicate numbers we find.

2. The for loop `for (int num : nums)` is an enhanced for loop (also known as a for-each loop). It iterates through each element in the `nums` array. In each iteration, `num` takes the value of the current element.

3. For each `num`, we do the following:
   - We check if `seen` already contains this number using `seen.contains(num)`.
   
   - If it does contain the number:
     - This means we've seen this number before, so it's a duplicate.
     - We add it to the `duplicates` list.
   
   - If it doesn't contain the number:
     - This is the first time we're seeing this number.
     - We add it to the `seen` set.

4. After the loop finishes, we return the `duplicates` list.

Let's walk through an example:

Suppose `nums = [4, 3, 2, 7, 8, 2, 3, 1]`

- First iteration: `num = 4`
  - `seen` is empty, so we add 4 to `seen`
  - `seen = [4]`, `duplicates = []`

- Second iteration: `num = 3`
  - 3 is not in `seen`, so we add it
  - `seen = [4, 3]`, `duplicates = []`

- Third iteration: `num = 2`
  - 2 is not in `seen`, so we add it
  - `seen = [4, 3, 2]`, `duplicates = []`

- Fourth iteration: `num = 7`
  - 7 is not in `seen`, so we add it
  - `seen = [4, 3, 2, 7]`, `duplicates = []`

- Fifth iteration: `num = 8`
  - 8 is not in `seen`, so we add it
  - `seen = [4, 3, 2, 7, 8]`, `duplicates = []`

- Sixth iteration: `num = 2`
  - 2 is already in `seen`, so we add it to `duplicates`
  - `seen = [4, 3, 2, 7, 8]`, `duplicates = [2]`

- Seventh iteration: `num = 3`
  - 3 is already in `seen`, so we add it to `duplicates`
  - `seen = [4, 3, 2, 7, 8]`, `duplicates = [2, 3]`

- Eighth iteration: `num = 1`
  - 1 is not in `seen`, so we add it
  - `seen = [4, 3, 2, 7, 8, 1]`, `duplicates = [2, 3]`

After the loop, we return `duplicates`, which contains `[2, 3]`.

This approach efficiently finds duplicates by using a HashSet, which allows for O(1) time complexity for both contains and add operations.
