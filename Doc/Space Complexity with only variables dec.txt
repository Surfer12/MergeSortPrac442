Space Complexity with only variables declared: O(1)
Space Complexity with additional space allocated: O(n)
Utilizing recursion vs using iterative approach:
- Recursion:
  - Space Complexity: O(log n) due to the call stack.
  - Pros:
    - Elegant and easy to understand for some problems.
    - Cleaner implementation for divide-and-conquer strategies.
  - Cons:
    - Can lead to stack overflow for large inputs.
    - Slower compared to iterative approaches.
